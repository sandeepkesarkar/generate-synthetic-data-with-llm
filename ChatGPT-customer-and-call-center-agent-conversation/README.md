Conversation Data Generation for Next GenAI Financial Corporation
Project Overview
This project focuses on generating realistic conversation data between a Next GenAI Financial Corporation call center agent and a customer. The data captures various customer inquiries about account-related topics and includes different levels of complexity in customer-agent interactions.

Steps Taken
Initial Prompt Design:

We began by defining a prompt to guide the generation of conversation data. The initial prompt specified the use of a professional tone for the agent and a neutral tone for the customer, with the option for conversations to vary from brief (4 exchanges) to comprehensive (12 exchanges).
Enhancements to the Prompt:

Throughout our journey, we refined the prompt to include:
Flexible Customer Topics: Allowing the customer to call about any account-related topic, enhancing the range of generated conversations.
Sensitive Information Handling: Incorporating a requirement for 20% of conversations to include sensitive information using various formats, based on an expanded PII list.
Agent Greeting: Emphasizing that the agent should greet the customer at the beginning of most calls.
Customer Authentication: Indicating that agents should answer the customer’s inquiry once they’re authenticated.
Filler Words and Realism: Adding filler words like "um," "hmm," and "uh" for natural speech, and personalizing customer personas to add realism.
File Management and Testing:

We created multiple versions of the prompt, updating the file names to reflect each version. This included saving the final prompt as Conversation_data_gen_prompt_004.txt.
Issues were encountered while attempting to create downloadable JSON files, but alternative methods were considered, and each prompt iteration was thoroughly documented.
Data Generation Attempts:

For use case 1.1.1 from 1_Account_Inquiries_usecases.json, we aimed to generate conversation data.
A request for 10 conversation records was specified. Due to technical issues with generating direct download links, alternative solutions were explored, including directly viewing the data.
Outcome and Next Steps
While some technical challenges were encountered, particularly with file generation and download capabilities, we successfully refined a comprehensive prompt that encapsulates realistic interactions for call center conversations. The prompt is ready for future data generation tasks, which can further enrich the dataset by addressing the challenges encountered.
