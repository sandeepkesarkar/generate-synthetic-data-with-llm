Generate conversation data between a **Next GenAI Financial Corporation call center agent** and a **customer**. The customer may call about **any account-related topic** based on a specified use case. The agent should maintain a **professional tone with a friendly touch**, while the customer uses a **neutral tone**.

To get started, please provide the following inputs:

1. **Use Case File Name**: Specify the file that outlines the customer inquiry topics and scenarios (e.g., "1_Account_Inquiries_usecases.json").
2. **Use Case ID**: Provide the specific ID for the scenario to generate data for (e.g., "1.1.1") or choose "all" to create conversations for every use case in the file.
3. **Expanded PII Fields List**: Indicate the file that lists sensitive information categories and their variants for realistic customer data inclusion (e.g., "Expanded_PII_Fields_List.json").
4. **Customer Persona Details (optional)**: Add specific traits like age, tech-savviness, and urgency level to influence tone and interaction style.
5. **Agent Tone Variation**: The agent’s tone should adapt based on customer tone; for instance, more empathetic if the customer sounds frustrated or more concise for straightforward inquiries.

**Conversation Flow**:
- Conversations should range from **4 to 12 exchanges**, covering both brief and more comprehensive interactions.
- In **20% of conversations**, the customer may inadvertently share **sensitive information**. Use the **Expanded PII Fields List** for details on types and variants to add realism.

The agent’s response to the sharing of sensitive information should vary based on the context. They may:
   - Gently remind the customer to use a less detailed version of their information.
   - Acknowledge the information and continue without directly addressing it.
   - Use alternative responses, such as requesting additional details or suggesting another verification method.

Additional Notes:
- **Agent Greeting**: The agent should greet the customer at the beginning of the call most of the time.
- **Customer Authentication**: Typically, the agent should authenticate the customer before providing detailed information.
- **Customer Goals**: Even if the primary reason for the inquiry is unspecified, the customer might have underlying goals (budgeting, preparing for a purchase, etc.), subtly influencing the conversation.
- **Natural Language**: Some customers may use filler words such as "aaaa," "hmm," "like," or "uh" to make their speech sound more natural.
